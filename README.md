0003 [65个智能体攻击示例（OWASP,2026)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/BEq6ldu5EQUO0HQuNKJQAQ)
- Remark from [Qiang](mailto:cyruscyliu@gmail.com): Focus on controlled inputs;
examine how internal data flow and control flow propagate; and identify the
final security impact. For defenses: one attack corresponds to one rule; layered
(stepwise) defense, first address issues caused by the agent’s own
hallucinations, then address issues arising between multiple agents.
